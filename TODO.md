**IMPORTANT:**

- proper rate-limiting
- use Bun's SQL driver instead of sqlite since it's async

**OTHER:**

- tweetapus circles like twiter circle

- somewhat improve the C algo

- nicer animations, such as when navigating between tweets and threads
- look into all XSS vulnerabitilies
- optimize client
- spinners on things that take time to load

**Joke:**

- @Bangers account automatically quoting tweets with more than 5 likes with "Certified xeetapus banger👑"
