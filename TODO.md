**IMPORTANT:**

- proper rate-limiting & captchas
- use Bun's SQL driver instead of sqlite since it's async

**OTHER:**

- i cant close the edit community modal

- tweetapus circles like twiter circle

- keyboard shortcuts
- db indexes for speedse's
- switching between accounts
- delegates
- when people change their pfp they get a popup asking them to tweet their new pfp + #NewProfilePic (done)

**Joke:**

- @Bangers account automatically quoting tweets with more than 5 likes with "Certified xeetapus banger👑"
