**IMPORTANT:**

- proper rate-limiting
- use Bun's SQL driver instead of sqlite since it's async

**OTHER:**

- tweetapus circles like twiter circle

- keyboard shortcuts
- db indexes for speed
- switching between accounts

**Joke:**

- @Bangers account automatically quoting tweets with more than 5 likes with "Certified xeetapus banger👑"
