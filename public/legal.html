          these terms and privacy policy guide how we handle your data and what
          you can do with our service.
        </h1>

        <h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>
        <p>
          tweetapus is based in portugal. by signing into tweetapus and
          accepting our policies, you agree to all these terms. if these terms
          change, we'll post an announcement on our site as we do not collect
          emails. as well, at times things can go wrong and the service may be
          interrupted. it's unlikely, but sometimes things can go really wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          tweetapus is provided as-is with the maximum limitations of liability
          permitted under portuguese and eu law. tweetapus is operated by an
          individual acting as the data controller. the service may be modified
          or terminated at any time if legally permissible.
        </p>

        <h2 id="terms">usage guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          you must meet the minimum age requirement for your jurisdiction to use
          tweetapus, otherwise you must be at least 13 years old (unless local
          law requires a higher age). you're responsible for keeping your
          account secure and for everything that happens on your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          you may not post or engage in any illegal content, harassment, spam,
          any form of nsfw content (including any sexually explicit content or
          gore, both images, videos, audios and text), or content designed to
          disrupt the service. you may not use unauthorized scraping,
          automation, bots, or attempt to find vulnerabilities in the service,
          including but not limited to evading ratelimits, sending any requests
          at an unreasonable rate, mass posting, tagging, dming, or blocking,
          and any other form of abuse.
        </p>

        <p>
          you own your content, but by posting on tweetapus you grant us a
          worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display,
          reproduce, distribute, and create non-derivative modifications such as
          formatting, thumbnails or previews for the purposes of operating,
          improving, promoting, and protecting the service. this license only
          applies to content you make public. you're responsible for everything
          you post and for having the rights to post it. if someone reports
          copyright infringement, we have the right to remove it ourselves, ask
          you to remove it, take legal action, or consider it invalid when
          legally reasonable.
        </p>

        <p>
          we can suspend or restrict your account if you violate these terms or
          applicable law. under the eu digital services act, if content is
          removed or your account is suspended, we will provide the reason for
          the action unless we are legally prevented from doing so. we have the
          choice to let you appeal this decision in-app, but you may always
          appeal to the portuguese courts.
        </p>

        <p>
          you use tweetapus at your own risk. we are not liable for loss of
          data, service interruptions, or other issues except where liability
          cannot be excluded under portuguese or eu law. these terms are
          governed by portuguese law and any disputes will be handled under
          portuguese jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2 id="privacy">your privacy</h2>
        <p>
          we collect all data we are required to to keep Tweetapus running and
          display other users content, including but not limited to your
          username, password hash, tweets, replies, retweets, likes,
          communities, followers, following, blocks, ip addresses, region-level
          location data, and session data. this data is collected for the
          purposes of providing the service, securing accounts, preventing
          abuse, complying with legal obligations, and improving the platform.
          the lawful bases are contract (running your account), legitimate
          interest (security and abuse prevention), and consent when required.
        </p>

        <p>
          by default, tweetapus may display the region or country associated
          with your last login and account creation for account security and
          transparency. you can adjust these settings in your profile under
          "account" to show only your country or continent. no precise personal
          information is shared.
        </p>

        <p>
          we use your data to run the service, show you content, connect you
          with other users, and improve the platform. we also use third-party
          services including unsplash for images, tenor for gifs, and openai for
          various features. these services have their own privacy policies but
          do not recieve your IP or any other device data, except unsplash and
          tenor when directly viewing images or gifs, which may recieve and
          collect information according to their privacy policies.
        </p>

        <p>
          we'll do our best to protect your data, but we can't guarantee
          absolute security. we use cookies and similar technologies to keep you
          logged in and understand how you use the service, including
          understanding how our service is doing, preventing abuse, storing your
          user id, caching and preloading content, storing consent information
          and other settings. we may share data with third parties if required
          by law or to comply with legally valid requests.
        </p>

        <h2 id="data">data & rights</h2>
        <p>
          your data is stored as long as your account exists. when you delete
          your account, most data is wiped immediately, though some data might
          take up to 1 week to be fully removed from backups and systems.
          certain data may be retained for a longer period if required by law
          such as for fraud prevention or abuse investigations.
        </p>

        <p>
          if you're in the eu or a region with similar privacy laws, you have
          certain rights including access to your data, deletion of your account
          and data, correction of your information, data portability, and the
          ability to object to processing based on legitimate interests. to
          exercise these rights, contact us at

        </p>

        <p>
          if you would like to contact tweetapus' data controller, please use
          the email above. tweetapus is operated by an individual acting as the
          controller in portugal. for privacy reasons, we will provide legally
          required information and process notices to portuguese authorities if
          requested under portuguese law, court orders, or other binding legal
          obligations.
