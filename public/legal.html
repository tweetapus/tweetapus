      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Last updated September 11, 2025</p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <p>
        Welcome to <b>Tweetapus</b>, a social networking platform operated from
        Portugal and available globally. These Terms of Service and this Privacy
        Policy form a legally binding agreement between you and Tweetapus. By
        creating an account, accessing the website, or otherwise using our
        services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to
        these provisions. If you do not accept them, you must immediately
        discontinue the use of Tweetapus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our aim is to provide a space for free expression and communication,
        subject to rules that keep the platform safe, lawful, and respectful for
        all users. Because this service involves both the creation of
        user-generated content and the storage of personal data, it is important
        that you understand your rights, your responsibilities, and our
        obligations under law, particularly the General Data Protection
        Regulation (“GDPR”).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Privacy</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Data We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign up for Tweetapus, we collect account information that you
        provide directly, such as your email address, chosen username, and
        authentication credentials in the form of passkeys. These details are
        essential to create and maintain your account, verify your identity, and
        enable secure access to the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect technical and network information such as IP
        addresses, browser type, device identifiers, and server logs. This
        information may be collected automatically as part of standard internet
        communication and is used to help us maintain system security, prevent
        abuse, and ensure that the service operates correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we store the content you create and share on Tweetapus,
        including posts, replies, profile details, and any other information you
        choose to make public or semi-public. Direct messages are also be stored
        on our servers and may or may not be end-to-end encrypted. While we take
        steps to secure this data, you should not assume that any message or
        communication on Tweetapus is completely private.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Cookies &amp; Local Storage</h3>
      <p>
        Tweetapus uses cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage
        in your browser) to ensure the service functions properly. These
        technologies are mostly first-party and are not shared with advertisers
        or external analytics providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use cookies and local storage to keep you logged in, remember your
        preferences, prevent abuse, and improve the overall user experience. No
        third-party tracking cookies are placed on your device, and your
        browsing activity outside Tweetapus is never monitored by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using Tweetapus, you consent to the use of cookies and local storage
        as described. You may configure your browser to refuse cookies or to
        alert you when cookies are being sent, but please note that certain
        features of the service may not function properly without them.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 How We Use Data</h3>
      <p>
        The personal data and user content we collect are used solely for the
        purpose of providing, maintaining, and improving the Tweetapus service.
        This includes authenticating your account, displaying content to other
        users, securing our systems, and enforcing our community standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data may also be used to investigate technical issues, respond to
        support inquiries, prevent fraudulent activity, and ensure compliance
        with applicable law. We do not use your personal data for advertising or
        for resale to third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Sharing of Data</h3>
      <p>
        Tweetapus does not sell your personal data under any circumstances. Your
        data will only be disclosed to third parties where required by
        applicable law, where necessary to protect the rights and safety of
        users and the service, or where essential to the technical operation of
        the platform (for example, cloud hosting or security providers operating
        under strict contractual agreements).
      </p>
      <p>
        In cases where disclosure is legally required, we will, where
        permissible and/or possible, attempt to notify the affected user before
        complying with such requests.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 Storage & Retention</h3>
      <p>
        All personal data is stored within the European Union, specifically in
        Portugal. Data will be retained for as long as it is necessary to
        operate the service, maintain user accounts, and comply with our legal
        obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you delete your account, we may remove or anonymize your personal
        data within a reasonable period of time, although some backups may
        persist temporarily. In limited cases, we may retain certain information
        if required by law or if necessary to resolve disputes and enforce our
        agreements. We are not required and are not able to delete or notify you
        of any 3rd-party archives.
      </p>

      <h3>2.6 GDPR Rights</h3>
      <p>
        If you are located in the EU, EEA, or another jurisdiction that provides
        similar protections, you have specific rights under the GDPR. These
        include the right to access your personal data, request correction of
        inaccurate data, request deletion of your data (“right to be
        forgotten”), restrict or object to the processing of your data, and
        request portability of your data in a commonly used machine-readable
        format.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exercise these rights, please contact us at by email using the
        address at the bottom of this document. We will respond to such requests
        in accordance with applicable law. You also have the right to lodge a
        complaint with your local supervisory authority for data protection if
        you believe your rights are being infringed.
      </p>

      <h3>2.7 Minors</h3>
      <p>
        Tweetapus is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13 years of age. By
        using the service, you represent and warrant that you are 13 years of
        age or older. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected data from
        a minor under 13, we will promptly delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Terms of Service</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        You may only use Tweetapus if you are at least 13 years old and legally
        permitted to do so in your jurisdiction. By registering for an account,
        you confirm that you meet this requirement. Use of the service by anyone
        who does not meet these conditions is strictly prohibited.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 User Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs under your
        account. This includes keeping your passkeys secure and not sharing them
        with others. We strongly recommend that you use secure devices and keep
        your login information confidential at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are also responsible for the content you post, transmit, or
        otherwise make available on Tweetapus. You agree not to use the service
        for unlawful purposes or in ways that violate the rights of others.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 Content Rules</h3>
      <p>
        By using Tweetapus, you agree not to post or share content that includes
        discrimination, harassment, doxxing, threats, or promotion of violence.
        Sexually explicit material, pornography, gore, or excessively violent
        imagery are strictly prohibited, even if marked as sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these rules or
        that we determine, in our sole discretion, is harmful to the community
        or the service. Repeated violations may result in account suspension or
        termination.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 Content Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        You retain all rights to the content you create. However, by submitting
        content on Tweetapus, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, display, and distribute
        your content as necessary to operate the service. This license ends when
        you delete your content or your account, except where your content has
        been shared by others and/or this is not reasonably possible.
      </p>

      <h3>3.5 Account Termination</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time,
        with or without notice, for any reason or no reason at all. This

        obligations, or risks to the security and integrity of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may deactivate or delete your account at any time. Upon deletion, we
        will try to remove or anonymize your personal data, subject to the
        retention rules described above.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not use the service for unlawful purposes or in ways that
        violate the rights of others. It is
        <i>recommended</i>
        to ask permission before creating multiple accounts but
        <i>required</i>
        before owning up to 5 accounts at any given time. You may not create any
        account in behalf of another person or entity.
      </p>

      <h3>3.6 Prohibited Uses</h3>
      <p>
        You agree not to use Tweetapus in any way that is unauthorized or
        unlawful. This includes attempting to scrape data, use automated bots,
        exploit vulnerabilities, disrupt service functionality, impersonate
        others, or otherwise interfere with the normal operation of the
        platform.
      </p>

      <h3>3.7 Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>
        The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We make
        no representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or
        implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability,
        fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. While we take
        steps to ensure security and reliability, we cannot guarantee that the
        service will always be available, error-free, or completely secure.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tweetapus and its operators
        shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
        consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of data, profits,
        goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your access to or
        use of the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no event shall our total liability to you for all claims exceed the
        amount you have paid to Tweetapus, if any, in the twelve months
        preceding the claim.
      </p>
