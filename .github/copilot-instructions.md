- NEVER use autoincrement IDs, always Bun.randomUUIDv7() instead
- DO NOT run migrations in the db.js file, which should NOT be bloated. Instead, use the SQLite3 CLI then update the schema.
- ALWAYS use Bun SQLite's prepared statements instead of functions that execute queries
- ALWAYS look for existing tables and USE THEM unless you have a good reason not to.
- DO NOT change code you're not supposed to
- AVOID using code comments
- ALWAYS use as little queries as possible to optimize performance
- NEVER use crypto.randomUUID(), instead ALWAYS use Bun.randomUUIDv7()
- ALWAYS use as little helper functions as possible
- DO NOT put stuff in weird places, like dataset to store stuff that can be stored in variables, OR calling functions using HTML events like onclick="x()"
- ALWAYS ASK and explain before doing permanent DB changes
