- NEVER use autoincrement IDs, always Bun.randomUUIDv7() instead
- DO NOT run migrations in the db.js file, which should NOT be bloated. Instead, use the SQLite3 CLI then update the schema.
- ALWAYS use Bun SQLite's prepared statements instead of functions that execute queries
- ALWAYS look for existing tables and USE THEM unless you have a good reason not to.
- DO NOT change code you're not supposed to
- AVOID using code comments
- ALWAYS use as little queries as possible to optimize performance
- NEVER use crypto.randomUUID(), instead ALWAYS use Bun.randomUUIDv7()
- ALWAYS use as little helper functions as possible
- DO NOT put stuff in weird places, like dataset to store stuff that can be stored in variables, OR calling functions using HTML events like onclick="x()"
- ALWAYS ASK and explain before doing permanent DB changes
- ALWAYS prefer TEMPLATE LITERALS over string concatenation
- NEVER USE PROFILES TABLE!!! It doesn't exist, use users instead.
- DONT USE user_id ON THE USERS TABLE, IT'S JUST id
- DO NOT CREATE PROFILES IF THEY DONT EXIST.
- IT'S NOT display_name, IT'S NAME.
- ALWAYS do fetch requests inline, like: `await (await fetch("/api/tweets/")).json();` instead of 2 variables.
- for fetching tweets, first fetch the tweet, then the profile. NEVER use joins for tweet+authors
- DO NOT set a content-type if the body is empty
- PREFER using background-color instead of background
